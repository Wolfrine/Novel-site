# Novel-site

Novel-site is a project for hosting and building the documentation for the NovaSaga project. The goal is to present the story online using a simple static site that will be expanded over time.

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Site

Start the local development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve the site locally so you can preview changes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Docusaurus Integration

We plan to integrate [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to manage documentation and allow a better reading experience. You can track progress in [NovaSaga](https://github.com/Wolfrine/NovaSaga).
